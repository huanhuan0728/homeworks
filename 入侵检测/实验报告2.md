   A model of a real-time intrusion-detection expert system capable of detecting break-ins, penetrations, and other forms of computer abuse is described. The model is based on the hypothesis that security violations can be detected by monitoring a system's audit records for abnormal patterns of system usage.
   
   描述了能够检测闯入、渗透和其他形式的计算机滥用的实时入侵检测专家系统的模型。 该模型基于这样的假设：可以通过监视系统的审核记录以发现系统使用的异常模式来检测安全违规行为。
   
   The model includes profiles for representing the behavior of subjects with respect to objects in terms of metrics and statistical models, and rules for acquiring knowledge about this behavior from audit records and for detecting anomalous behavior.
   
   该模型包括用于在度量和统计模型方面表示主体相对于对象的行为的配置文件，以及用于从审计记录获取有关此行为的知识和检测异常行为的规则。

   The model is independent of any particular system, application environment, system vulnerability, or type of intrusion, thereby providing a framework for a general purpose intrusion-detection expert system.
   
   该模型独立于任何特定系统、应用环境、系统漏洞或入侵类型，从而为通用入侵检测专家系统提供了框架。
2. introduction
   
   This paper describes a moder for a real-time intrusion-detection expert system that aims to detect a wide range of security violations ranging from attempted breakins by outsiders to system penetrations and abuses by in-siders. 

   本文描述了实时入侵检测专家系统的模型，旨在检测各种安全违规行为，从外部人员试图入侵到内部人员的系统渗透和滥用。
   
   The development of a real-time intrusion-detection system is motivated by four factors:
   
   实时入侵检测系统的开发受到四个因素的推动：

   1)most existing systems have security flaws that render them susceptible to intrusions, penetrations, and other forms of abuse; finding and fixing all these deficiencies is not feasible for technical and economic reasons;

   1）大多数现有系统都存在安全缺陷，使其容易受到入侵、渗透和其他形式的滥用； 由于技术和经济原因，查找并解决所有这些缺陷是不可行的；

   2)existing systems with known flaws are not easily replaced by systems that are more secure mainly because the systems have attractive features that are missing in the more-secure systems, or else they can not be replaced for economic reasons;

   2）具有已知缺陷的现有系统不容易被更安全的系统取代，主要是因为这些系统具有更安全的系统所缺少的有吸引力的功能，或者由于经济原因而无法被取代；

   3)developing systems that are absolutely secure is extremely difficult, if not generally impossible; and4)even the most secure systems are vulnerable to abuses by insiders who misuse their privileges.

   3）开发绝对安全的系统即使不是一般不可能，也是极其困难的； 4）即使是最安全的系统也容易受到滥用其特权的内部人员的滥用。

   The model is based on the hypothesis that exploitation of a system's vulner abilities involves abnormal use of the system; therefore, security violations could be detected from abnormal patterns of system usage. The following examples illustrate:

   该模型基于这样的假设：利用系统的漏洞能力涉及系统的异常使用； 因此，可以从系统使用的异常模式中检测到安全违规行为。 下面的例子说明：

   * Attempted break-in: Someone attempting to break into a system might generate an abnormally high rate of password failures with respect to a single account or the system as a whole.
  
   尝试闯入：尝试闯入系统的人可能会对单个帐户或整个系统产生异常高的密码失败率。
  
   * Masquerading or successful break-in: Someone logging into a system through an unauthorized account and password might have a different login time, location,or connection type from that of the account's legitimate user. In addition, the penetrator's behavior may differ considerably from that of the legitimate user; in particular, he might spend most of his time browsing through directories and executing system status commands, whereas the legitimate user might concentrate on editing or compiling and linking programs.
     
   伪装或成功闯入：通过未经授权的帐户和密码登录系统的人可能与该帐户的合法用户的登录时间、位置或连接类型不同。此外，渗透者的行为可能与该帐户的合法用户有很大不同
特别是，他可能花费大部分时间浏览目录并执行系统状态命令，而合法用户可能专注于编辑或编译和链接程序。

   Many break-ins have been discovered by security officers or other users on the system who have noticed the alleged user be having strangely.

   许多入侵行为是由安全官员或系统上的其他用户发现的，他们注意到被指控的用户有奇怪的行为。

   * Penetration by legitimate user: A user attempting to penetrate the security mechanisms in the operating system might execute different programs or trigger more protection violations from attempts to access unauthorized files or programs. If his attempt succeeds, he will have access to commands and files not normally permitted to him.

   合法用户的渗透：尝试渗透操作系统中的安全机制的用户可能会执行不同的程序或因尝试访问未经授权的文件或程序而触发更多的保护违规。 如果他的尝试成功，他将可以访问通常不允许他访问的命令和文件。

   Leakage by legitimate user: A user trying to leak sensitive documents might login to the system at unusual times or route data to remote printers not normally used.

   合法用户泄露：试图泄露敏感文档的用户可能会在异常时间登录系统或将数据路由到通常不使用的远程打印机。

   Inference by legitimate user: A user attempting to obtain unauthorized data from a database through aggregation and inference might retrieve more records thanusual.

   合法用户的推理：尝试通过聚合和推理从数据库获取未经授权的数据的用户可能会检索到比平常更多的记录。

   Trojan horse: The behavior of aTrojan horse planted in or substituted for a program may differ from the legitimate program in terms of its CPU time or I/O activity.

   特洛伊木马：植入或替代程序的特洛伊木马的行为可能在 CPU 时间或 I/O 活动方面与合法程序不同。

   Virus: A virus planted in a system might cause an increase in the frequency of executable files rewritten, storage used by executable files, or a particular program being executed as the virus spreads.

   病毒：植入系统中的病毒可能会导致可执行文件重写的频率、可执行文件使用的存储空间或随着病毒传播而执行的特定程序增加。

   Denial-of-Service: An intruder able to monopolize a resource (e.g.,network) might have abnormally high activity with respect to the resource, while activity for all other users is abnormally low.

   拒绝服务：能够垄断资源（例如网络）的入侵者可能对该资源具有异常高的活动，而所有其他用户的活动异常低。

   Of course, the above forms of aberrant usage can also be linked with actions unrelated to security.They could be a sign of a user changing work tasks,acquiring new skills, or making typing mistakes; software updates; or changing workload on the system. An important objective of our current research is to determine what activities and statistical measures provide the best discriminating power; that is, have a high rate of detection and a low rate of false alarms.

   当然，上述形式的异常使用也可能与与安全无关的操作有关。它们可能是用户改变工作任务、获得新技能或犯打字错误的迹象； 软件更新； 或改变系统的工作负载。 我们当前研究的一个重要目标是确定哪些活动和统计措施可以提供最佳的区分能力； 即检测率高、误报率低。
